# Web integration guide for Mugen Wallpaper

This document explains how a web page running inside the appâ€™s WKWebView can consume:
- System metrics injected by the native app.
- Synthetic mousemove events generated by the app to keep hover/interaction responsive.
- The current screen index where the page is displayed.

No special setup is required on your page beyond adding event listeners.

## What the app injects

1) Synthetic mousemove events
- Event type: "mousemove"
- Dispatched on: window
- Coordinates: clientX/clientY in CSS pixels, relative to the top-left of the viewport, matching standard browser semantics.

2) Native system metrics events
- Event type: "nativeMetrics" (CustomEvent)
- Dispatched on: window
- Frequency: ~1 time per second
- Payload (event.detail) shape:

```json

  "cpu": {
    "totalPercent": 0.0

  "memory": {
